# HIP-Examples
Examples for HIP.  

This depot should be extracted into the root directory of an existing [HIP repot](https://github.com/GPUOpen-ProfessionalCompute-Tools/HIP) and retain the name HIP-Examples, ie:

HIP/HIP-Examples

We managed to push the following benchmarks with HIP upstreamed on github:

* mixbench: https://github.com/ekondis/mixbench
* GPU-STREAM: https://github.com/UoB-HPC/GPU-STREAM

mixbench and GPU-STREAM has been added as submodules for this repository, to fetch data for submodules:

    git submodule init

    git submodule update
